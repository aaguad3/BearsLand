      <div class="bears-facts">
        <div class="fact1">
          <li>Bears' diets vary from each species. Polar bears being mostly carnivorous
              while panda bears feeding mostly on bamboo.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact2">
          <li>Bears are well known for their lengthy hibernation periods that take place
              in the winter. They go the entire hibernation period without waking and their
              heart beat slows to 9bpm.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact3">
          <li>Bears are most commonly found in North America, Europe, and Asia.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact4">
          <li>Bears live as long as 30 years in the wild. One captive brown bear lived to the age of 47.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact5">
          <li>A male bear is called a boar or a he-bear. A female bear is called a sow or
              a she-bear. A group of bears is called a sleuth or sloth.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact6">
          <li>The world’s most widely distributed bear is the brown bear.
              However, the American black bear is the world's most common bear species.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="fact8">
          <li>Once bears breed, they go their separate ways. Male bears do not help the mother
              bear raise the cubs. Depending on the breed, intercourse may last a few minutes
              (giant panda) or half an hour (polar bear).</li>

        <div class="fact9">
          <li>Black bears are typically smaller than grizzly bears, have a smaller shoulder hump,
              less shaggy fur, longer ears, and a less concave facial profile. Black bear claws
              are also smaller and more curved to better climb trees.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="fact10">
          <li>Stone-age hunters worshipped and hunted bears at the same time. To show their respect,
              they sang and danced and prayed that the bear would forgive them for killing it.</li>

        <p>In 2004, a black bear was found unconscious in a campground in Seattle, Washington.
        It had broken into a cooler and used its claws and teeth to open dozens of beer cans.
        Although it sampled other types of beer, it chose to drink all the cans of only one type
        of beer. After its drinking binge, the bear passed out.</p>
